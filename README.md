# LPG Gas leakage detector using 8051 Microcontroller
The main objective of this project report is to deal with the design and testing of an LPG leakage detector with the 8051 series of ATMELâ€™s microcontrollers. The project uses the 8051 variant AT89S52(8051). The program for configuring the microcontroller was written in Keil Microvision 3IDE, designed for ATMEL 8051 series microcontrollers.
